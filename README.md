# Mert Karadayı

🦀 Rustacean in training.  
Ex-frontrow seat holder to university lectures I barely remember.(Computer Engineering)  
Now making up for it by reading *actual books* and writing *actual code*.

## Previously:
- Launched an anonymous NFT project that actually worked (seriously)
- 4+ years trading crypto and forex — charts, chaos, caffeine
- Used more web3 projects than most people have wallet extensions
- Built WordPress/Elementor sites in college to afford coffee and cloud hosting: [imertkaradayi.com](https://imertkaradayi.com/)
- Interned 6 months at **Gowit** as a backend dev — wrote Go, pushed code, and occasionally understood what was happening

## Currently:
- Wrote a whole backend in Rust and didn’t cry (much)
- Working on **[GüneşCepte](https://gunes-cepte.vercel.app/)** – a solar investment platform for real-world impact
- DJing minimal techno while learning multithreading (because silence is overrated)
- Living inside Neovim (yes, I configured it from scratch)
- Addicted to productivity systems I’ll probably abandon next month
- Learning Rust seriously: Tokio, thiserror, and all the edge cases
